My current rerserch focuses on **language grounding** and **formalization** to robotics alongside **knowledge representation and planning**.
I have worked towards formalize and represnt rules and specifications for autonomous system using large language model and my further interest included grounding the formalized knowledge to the planning and prediction componnet of autonomous agents. 

Part of my role is at **Continental Automotive** is being a Research Scientist for their autonomous driving department. In my free time, you can find me reading books and recently I acquired a taste in playing Table tennis.
